# **MiniFS ‚Äì A Simple Virtual File System in C**


This project implements a simple virtual file system in C, developed as part of the *Systemprogrammierung* course at TU Berlin (SS23). It mimics core file system concepts such as INodes, superblocks, block storage, and a shell-like interface for user interaction.

---

## üìÇ Features

- Create, list, write to, read from, and delete files or directories
- Import/export files between the host system and the virtual file system
- Data persistence via `.fs` file
- INodes for metadata and directory structure
- Block-based data storage with a free block manager
- CLI shell for interaction with the file system

## getting Started

### Compile the project

```bash
make
```

### Create a new file system

```bash
./build/ha2 -c myfs.fs 64
```

### Load existing file system

```bash
./build/ha2 -l myfs.fs
```

## Testing

- Tests can be executed with:

```bash
make test
```

- Individual command tests via:

```bash
make test mkdir
```
